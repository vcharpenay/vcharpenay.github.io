I am a PhD candidate affiliated with the [University of
Passau](http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/verteilte-informationssysteme/)
(Germany) in collaboration with [Siemens Corporate
Technology](http://ct.siemens.com/) and member of the W3C [Web of Things
working group](https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/). I hold a double-degree in Computer
Science from the engineering school [INSA Lyon](http://insa-lyon.fr/) and
the University of Passau. My research topics include semantics for the Web
of Things, knowledge management and exchange in embedded environments.
