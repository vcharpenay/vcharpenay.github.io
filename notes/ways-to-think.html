    Idea of Marvin Minksy: "Ways to Think" and hierarchical thinking (with critics/selectors).
    See p. 226-227 of <i>The Emotion Machine</i>.
    
    Experiments in psychology: model theory and reasoning: the result is "reasoners" implement different strategies.
    Identified 5 Ways to Think (or kinds of reasoning).
    
    Is there a selection algorithm for these different ways to think? Is the selection problem decidable? If so, there should be heuristics to help automated reasoners to perform (much) better.
