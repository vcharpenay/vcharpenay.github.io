    <h1>Intelligence and Common Sense</h1>

    Human intelligence: fast and forward thinking, high level of perception. First aspect is
    what classical AI has been focusing one. Second aspect comes with the IoT.

    But ML is of a different nature. It is more about common sense than intelligence. Indeed,
    language models are good at efficiently encoding patterns humans have been collectively
    producing, not at creating new ones... What we aim at is to make machines adapt to our
    view of the world, which is precisely defined by our shared knowledge, regardless of how
    it was acquired.

    Computer vision tasks are are obsessed by the symbols we have assigned to physical world entities.
    It is however trivial to the majority of humans to adapt their perception to these symbols,
    regardless of the "intelligence" others recognize in them.

    On reinforcement learning tasks, like playing games, evolutionary algorithms can compete
    with neural networks. Given the computational power of AlphaZero, maybe the efficacy of the
    heuristics plays a secondary role compared to pure space search coverage.

    The part of deep learning that is "intelligent" is more the algorithm itself than its various
    instances (put differently, it is the method, not the tasks). Tasks.
