    <h1>A New Blockworld for Artificial Intelligence</h1>

    Why should we reuse classical AI techniques 30 years after machine learning overtook research?

    The main issue with earlier research on classical AI was the complexity of axiomatizing the laws
    of the physical world. But if numeric simulations can simulate it, it should now be possible to
    perform reasoning over such simulations.

    How? By providing a simplified representation of the physical world, or should I say, a <i>bounded</i>
    representation of the physical world that can be simulated. WoT provides such a representation.
    Classical AI has its new blockworld.
