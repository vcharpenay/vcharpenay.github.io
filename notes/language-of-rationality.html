    ...and the undecidability of its truth.

    Different formulations, different results

    (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCUuM8F_0VE)

    The basic assumption of a 'reliable predictor' is self-referential.
    If it is considered to exist, it also know what the player thinks.
    But the player is also reasoning over what the predictor "knows".

    See also "The lesson of Newcomb's paradox" for a game-theoretic treatment:
    two interpretations, two games (with different optimal strategies).
