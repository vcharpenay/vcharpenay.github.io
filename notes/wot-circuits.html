    <h1>Distributed Cyber-Physical Systems As Virtual Circuits</h1>

    <p class="info">

    </p>

    Briefly: like an electric circuit, with simple (simplified) and <em>standardized</em> components.

    Instead of hard wires, we simply have communication sockets.

    Actually like processes but for reactive systems (no beginning, no end).

    What is the best representation for such systems? ... Knowledge graphs.
