    Science: provide a message simple enough for everyone to update their internal model/reproduce a reasoning process that leads to a given conclusion.
    On the importance of popularization of scientific theories, not to accelerate technological transfer but to align our respective models of the physical world.

    See previous note on "scientific thinking" and truth: find a counterexample or "enough" examples.

    Compatible with the idea of solving puzzles (Kuhn)?
