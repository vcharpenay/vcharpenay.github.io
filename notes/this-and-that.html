    How important is a vocabulary in a language?
    
    Conjecture: one can explain a Roman, in Latin, the principles of quantum physics (such that they understand).
    If the conjecture is true, it means only a basic vocabulary to describe the physical world is required, which modern languages and Latin have in common. What can that vocabulary be?
    
    Conjecture: assuming FOL, the only word that is necessary is "that". A plain reference to physical world entities. (It implies that a language also requires an index finger...).
    
    Experiment: MAS that generates a language to describe physical phenomena (e.g. in a consensus-based prediction task).
