    Insists on the importance of categories and their (hidden) political agenda.
    Essay on ImageNet: <a href="https://www.excavating.ai/">excavating.ai</a>.

    Yes, ImageNet is biased. And yes, it is even more worrisome to see "AI" experiments turn
    into products knowing that data acquisition is more and more driven by private capitals.

    It is therefore important to base product-quality machine learning on datasets
     - with public read access
     - with public write access

    Which is nothing but the project behind the Wikimedia foundation. A bias must first be
    detected or confirmed (first condition) and fixed (second condition).

    It could be restrained in some cases. For instance:
     - read access for the group targeted by systems with automated decision trained in this dataset
     - write access under license conditions (like for a driving license)

    Classification is a social activity (ontology: shared representation). Krawford, 25'.

    In the case of language models (BERT, ...), one could argue that "the Web" is a good approximation
    of our societies. But no. It only captures the Web at a given time. Example of CIFAR, the face dataset
    Krawford mentions: from 2002 to 2004, during W. Bush term. He is overrepresented in the dataset.

    This note mostly addresses the question raised by Facebook researchers asking whether
    BERT and friends were not the future of knowledge graphs: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066.
    The answer is: no. How can humans "edit" a language model?

    Agreement can only come from languages: an external set of shared practices.
