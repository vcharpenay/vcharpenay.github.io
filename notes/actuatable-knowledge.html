    <h1>On the Power of Knowledge</h1>

    Why would one want to structure Wikipedia into something like Wikidata?
    Quite simply: because it is easier to act on it. Knowing something generally
    implies the action of whoever possesses the knowledge is partially conditioned
    by that knowledge. Conversely, doing something implies the prior existence of some
    form of knowledge.

    Now, when knowledge is ground into real-valued vectors (aka embeddings),
    the relationship between knowing and doing is not expressed in terms of logical
    necessity (or probable necessity) but in "geometric" terms.

    The theory of relativity also gives a geometric interpretation of things by
    expressing physical events in a single spacetime continuum. (The analogy reveals
    the importance of an observer, i.e. of a basis that every coordinate system requires.)

    The behavior of agents generally being specified in terms of external stimuli and
    internal drives, the question of "acting" on knowledge is that of specifying geometric
    transformations. Similarly, causality is expressed as equations between measurable
    quantities within the vector space.

    Other examples: does an angle of 45Â° between two "things/""events" mean implication,
    subsumption, mutual exclusion, ...?

    Hypothesis: acting is just "reading" knowledge in the form of processes (action plans).
    Reading, here, means moving a cursor over knowledge, the same way an observer locates
    a physical event moving in space and time.
