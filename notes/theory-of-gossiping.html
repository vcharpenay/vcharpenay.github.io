    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar">Robin Dunbar</a>'s theory of gossiping.
    See maybe "Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language"?
    (see also Dunbar's number: how many relationships can one maintain?)

    Dunbar introduced in Yuval Harari's Sapiens.

    Gossip ~ reported speech.

    Reported speech is where any theory of language starts.
    Is gossiping also a starting point for symbolic learning?
