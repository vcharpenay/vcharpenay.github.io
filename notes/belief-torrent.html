    Relationship between BitTorrent and "viral" spreading of information on social media? There is a threshold (w.r.t the number of agents) above which selfish agents can spread information reliably by "chaining". The unique source is unknown shortly after it starts spreading and there soon is a mass of agents sharing the "information" as a belief to speak about "public opinion".
    
    Related note: Reading about the disinformation campaign by the Daily Mail during Hitler's time as Chancellor. A journalist writes "Der Angriff says that P", their editor cuts and leaves "P"... Der Angriff quotes the cut article stating that "The Daily Mail also believes that P". On the informativeness of modalities. Similar anecdote with Wikipedia serving as citation. There exists a formal system that prevents such things from happening: sources must be either permanent ("always P") and unconditional ("not Q, s.t. Q implies always P") or sourced ("A believes P").
