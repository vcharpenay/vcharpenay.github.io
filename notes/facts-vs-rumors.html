    Anecdote in Apocalypse Now: the Usanian army goes to an occupied village to inoculate children against Polio.
    The local population is suspicious, they hack off their own children's arms. (2'10)
    
    Less dramatic but same story in our reality around Ebola, in RDC (Les Jours).
    
    Modality of belief and group knowledge (Nillson, Genesereth, Ch. X "Belief and Knowledge") to analyze the effect of news spreading on social networks?
    
    AÂ group is biased towards believing Ebola is a conspiracy. Is there a knowledge acquisition model that accounts for that effect when:
    
    <ol>
        <li>facts ("The WHO is here to help") are not often expressed within the network and</li>
        <li>other facts suggesting alternative explanations ("The government is not helping against militias") are directly experienced by network nodes?</li>
    </ol>
    
    The urge to provide an exogenic explanation for negative experiences may lead to unconsidering filling the blank with explanations despite contradictory evidence.
    Coming back to the idea of truth as a time-constrained process, it may the temporality of utterances that is key:
    if the contradictory evidence is expressed in too dense a network of believers of the contrary, its spreading stops.
    
    Other hypothesis: facts that relate to direct experience are stronger to derive other facts that facts asserted elsewhere, even if the latter contradict the derived ones.
