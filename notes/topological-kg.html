    Comparison of GloVe and BabelNet: what transformation to apply from vector spaces to graphs?

    Field of topological graph theory? Then, we could compare the respective coverage of word embeddings (like GloVe) and KGs.

    For instance, imagine each edge represents a spatial constraint (fixed distance between two nodes),
    we can start defining geometric transformations between the two (rotation, translation, scaling, inversion)
