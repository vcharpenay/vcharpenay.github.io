# Random Thoughts

- reading "The Nature of Reasoning" : can we not express all biases detected in human behavior in terms of FOL?
  - for instance, confirmation bias: on an open world, undefined truth value of infinitely many axioms
  - validity of bound rationality on real world reasoning tasks? -> could be axiomatized?

- the same way existential reasoning is "incomplete" if we deal with Skolem constants in an ABox, reasoning in modal logics without modalities for some statements cannot produce sound conclusions. Similarly, in ubiquitous computing, WoT, etc., the necessary "context" to interpret sentences or data samples is provided by sensor measurements. Can be seen as the modalities of WoT reasoning?
- what is an agent, what not? Think of the question as what the responsibility of individuals is, in the chain of command in the Nazi regime...
- maths is about structuring one's reasoning; CS is about structuring one's data
  - that's how you get math research of the kind 'finite automata are like context-free grammars, are like semigroups, are like modal logics, are like...'
  - cf Stephane Mallat who opposes maths and CS in the recent progress made in 'data sciences'.
- différence chimie-physique : axiomatique dans les deux cas. Mais éléments du modèle dans 1 cas. Du méta-modèle dans l'autre ?
