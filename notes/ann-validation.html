    <h1>Model Checking for Neural Network Architectures</h1>

    Idea: great diversity of neural network architectures (each time, the main contribution of a paper).
    Can we axiomatize/describe an architecture in a logical form and thus restrict the kind of models
    that can be produced by it?

    Was reading two papers from TheWebConf:
     - variational autoencoder + classifaction-reproduction  (FiDo)
     - CNN + Graph embeddings + attention improves bike sharing platform usage predication (GACNN)
     - CNN + capsule networks + dense networks (STGCapNet)

     Looks more and more like block diagrams with standard functions used for general-purpose flow-based programming.

     We can perform model checking on these "diagrams". The universe in that case is ...?

     Also, subsumption of (classes of) architectures can be computed using classical model-theoretic techniques.
