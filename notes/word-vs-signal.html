    "It's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means." (Apocalypse Now - 2'10).
    
    Robert and Stuart Dreyfus, Mind over Machine:Â when one learns how to drive, one learns how to recognize from the sound of a motor when to change gear.
    This knowledge cannot be encoded in rules, they argue. Can they not? An automatic gear box would not listen to the motor but read the RPM counter (rotations per minute): from a signal with 100s of dimensions (how many dimensions does a NN need to recognize sounds?) to 1 dimension.
    
    NNs do a good job at reducing dimensions and if we had to descibe sounds, we would need roughly as many words as there are dimensions in an NN's vector space 
    (+ the number of possible values in each dimension, 256 for the 8bit floating point arithmetics used in today's hardware).
    Rules would just be an alternative representation of the vector space, sometimes even more concise (because it encode well recurrent patterns).
    
    The Dreyfus brothers keep comparing competent beginners with true experts and argue that experts do not get their expertise from rules but from pattern recognition, from example (or, to put it differently, experience). But experts also often invent their own vocabulary.
    It's true that words are mostly meant for conversations between experts, not for direct action.
    But don't the words they create also influence/restructure their internal knowledge representation?
 
    Is it possible for words to describe the horror of war? Is there an alternative to Apocalypse Now to describe it?
