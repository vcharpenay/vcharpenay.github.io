    <h1>Semantic Interoperability and Discourse (II)</h1>

    <p>
        Introduction to semantic interoperability given at a winter school (<a href="">pdf</a>).
        Mostly made of references commonly accepted in the SOTA.
        But intuition SOTA isn't targeting the right problems: aren't all forms of interoperabiltiy necessarily <em>semantic</em>?
    </p>

    <p>
        Interoperability: exchange of information between independent systems.
        Examples:
        <a href="https://www.buildingsmart.org/standards/bsi-standards/industry-foundation-classes/">IFC</a> (for construction data exchange),
        <a href="http://www.emsa.europa.eu/cise.html">CISE</a> (for international maritime surveillance).
    </p>

    <p>
        Moving from interop to <em>semantic</em> interop: moving from XSD to OWL. What for?
        Mostly for stating e.g. <code>MyCompanyClass subClassOf CommonClass</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To what extent is subsumption used/useful?
        Without OWL, the emitter is responsible for projecting its data onto a common model and the receiver is responsible for doing the opposite transformation.
        With OWL, the emitter is responsible instead for projecting its data <em>model</em> onto the common model.
        The receiver then is responsible for making the alignment but it still has to project the data represented in a common model onto its own.
    </p>

    <p>
        Commonality between IFC and CISE: both names and initial design suggest a much wider scope than what they are effectively used for (construction vs. entire industry, maritime surveillance vs. all government regulation activity).
