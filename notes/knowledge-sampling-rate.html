    <h1>The Sampling Rate of Knowledge</h1>

    Was reading a paper about Edison, a naive physics engine.

    Reminds me of lumped representation. One can describe a full system with various granularities.
    Every primitive function is given a name and composed with other functions (recursively).

    Such a system representation, can be sampled in any way, every sample is also a system.
    What is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling rate starting from which no information about the original system is lost?

    Applications of such research: method for learning system representations from sensor/actuator reading.
    Acceleration of existing learning techniques by providing simplifed (but strictly more generic) system representations
