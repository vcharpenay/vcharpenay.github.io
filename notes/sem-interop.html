      Syntactic, structural, semantic interop (classification by Amit Sheth).
  
      Isn't what we've all been doing for the past 20y?

      Semantic interop may be nonesensical if we think of it: languages are not meant to be
      "executed" but understood/interpreted. A schema, a piece of code, a specification is
      really like an utterance, a speech act: it was adressed to another agent with some
      intent. Trying to make two agent interoperate, given that their mutual utterances are
      mutually interpreted the wrong way, is probably not going to be solved by a third
      person telling them something.
      
      It is like sparkling a fight. Authoritarian interoperability.

      Alternative: conversational interop?
