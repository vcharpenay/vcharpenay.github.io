    <h1>Hume's Theory of Human Associations</h1>

    <p class="info">

    KGs as a materialization of human associations: resemblence, adjacency in time/space, causality.
    According to Hume (cited by Kahneman in 'think slow, think fast').

    But if causality is axiomatized as a temporal correlation, we only have two possible assocations.

    The first can be quantified as the height of common ancestors (in terms of properties?).
    Can it be axiomatized?

    The second can be axiomatized with 'local' time/space algebras?
    (Otherwise, Allen's algebra e.g. connects every instant to all others.)
