    <h1>My Take on 'Truth'</h1>

    <p>
        In logics, truth has a rather clear definition. One may want to question the relevance
        of assigning a truth value to every statement but this binary valuation of pieces of
        information represents a solid foundation for any computer science theory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now, how does truth emerge within human organizations? How can computational logics help
        understand 'fake news', mis- and disinformation, conspiracy theories and other phenomena
        related to the new Internet media?
    </p>

    <p>
        Statements are often considered as 'opinions' as long as they are not scientifically proven
        to be objective 'facts'. In fact, the scientific process rather consists in the strenghening
        of a consensus on the truth of statements by means of repeated experimentation (as theoretized
        by Thomas Kuhn). This process thus involves social networks and agent interactions; it should
        not be understood as depending only on the statement itself (and its relationship to the
        physical world).
    </p>

    <p>
        To get an idea of the social aspect of scientific 'fact checking', let us go back to basics:
        a fact can be considered as scientific if it is
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>refutable (i.e. if some observation can contradict it) and</li>
        <li>non-refuted (i.e. if no observation so far has contradicted it).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        While the former criterion is inherent to the statement (Karl Popper extensively discussed that
        point), the former does imply someone has done <em>prior research</em> to provide a refutation.
        Taken individually, every attempt at refutating a statement could be given a truth in an
        reasonably objective manner. When someone claims that they observed the Higgs boson, others
        can assert they indeed did and even reproduce the result, if logistically possible. (At this
        point, as a simplification and despite its relevance to the question, let us restrict
        ourselves to non-temporal statements and send our apologies to historian.)
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet, scientific research is is an open-ended process: one may never stop trying to refutate
        someone else's theory, as long as they do not achieve the right observation. This is where
        consensus comes into play. A statement becomes a scientific 'fact' whenever a community
        decides they have had enough and stop chasing contradictory observations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that this description of scientific research bears a resemblance to semi-decidable
        decision procedures... And indeed, it is all but computable:Â choosing what observations (or
        experiments) to make depends on the theory, which itself emerges from on past observations.
    </p>

    <p>
        What is known for certain is: scientific research is a process, with a certain duration.
        Taken in a broad sense, what also includes any attempt to prove a conspirationist video wrong
        or to examine dubious statements in a blog post found online, scientific research
        <em>necessarily takes time</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        After establishing this condition, it is somewhat easier to understand how mis- and disinformation
        grows when information spreads faster than research can go. A
        <a href="https://datasociety.net/output/oxygen-of-amplification/">report by a digital media researcher</a>
        on the amplification by traditional media of marginal (a.k.a alt-right) political stances underlines
        the importance of trolling and memes in this phenomenon. Memes are always synonyms for fast and continuous
        (viral) spreading of information. The result is: scientific thinking does not stand a chance. Mass
        communication imposes a competition for truth on contradictory statements whose truth value cannot be
        evaluated on time. Here is my take on 'truth'.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: this emergent phenomenon of 'fake news' overruning scientific thinking may be simulated for
        further studies using some multi-agent system. It is important to have scientific research on this...
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        Importance of the Overton window when we look at frequencies. Important to
        understand the power of memes. Organic reach vs. echo chamber, amplification.
        Amplification: news ricocheting distinct communities. Difference in interpretation
        and a resulting antagonism that forces middle individuals to choose their side.
