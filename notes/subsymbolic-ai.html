    <h1>On the Frontier Between Symbolic and Subsymbolic Knowledge Representations</h1>

    The term 'subsymbolic logic' resonates as a somewhat clear concept. It implies the existence
    of a border between symbolic and subsymbolic logic.

    But maybe, no one has really attempted to cross this border (maintaining this narrative of 'Us' vs. 'Them').

    Anecdote: 'Maybe computing could be more efficient if it had more than two possible values (true, false)? Dunno.'
    It seems this is what some researchers tend to think when they seek ways of encoding behaviors into algebraic
    operations.

    Symbolic logic ~ Boolean algebra. It is a 'small' algebraic space.
    Bigger spaces, like reals (in rings/fields) ~ higher expressivnesss?

    Interestingly, we are now talking about 'supersymbolic' theories, in regard to the size of their data space.

    Note: we do not talk about the lexical space anymore (which has always been made of symbols) but the result of
    interpretation. I.e. the space onto which symbols are projected. To put in parallel to Searle's Chinese Room
    analogy: "an AI system is like some Westerner translating Chinese given a pre-defined method but without
    understanding any of what it tranlates".

    Literature: Nilsson talks first about sub-symbolic AI ('AI: A New Synthesis')?. Hubert Dreyfus talks about
    intuition as part of intelligence?
