    <h1>On (Knowledge) Science vs. Engineering</h1>

    <p>
        Is there such a thing as 'knowledge science'?
    </p>

    <p>
        The concept is easy to define as the opposite of 'knowledge engineering' but one
        question remains: does knowledge science as a concept even make sense? Knowledge
        engineering is a well-established field but it is somewhat confusing that most
        knowledge engineers are also researchers. The Semantic Web, as the strongest example
        of this phenomenon, is mostly maintained, developed and used by the same researchers
        in a semi-porous environment. Is the big toolbox they have been creating (a.k.a. RDF)
        the product  of research, is it also a theory of knowledge?
    </p>

    <h2>The "Sciences of Engineering"</h2>

    <p>
        Here is a cheap dialectics to help answer the question: engineers do, scientists observe.
        The difference lies in the fact that the action of engineers impact our world while
        scientists always tend to extract themselves from it to seek 'objectivity'. In that
        respect, what the Semantic Web community is doing—what a wise wording...—is somewhat
        amgibiguous. On the one hand, datasets as they appear on the
        <a href="https://www.lod-cloud.net/">Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud</a> come from monitoring
        and curating information that is already on the Web (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, etc.),
        thus tending towards <em>scientific</em> work. But on the other hand, the Semantic Web
        community likes to think that the very result of that curation work is actually used
        by high-tech companies. It seems to be the case for IBM Watson
        (<a href="https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2303">DBpedia and
        YAGO are used as sources</a>) and it would hardly be a surprise if Google's Knowledge
        Graph tapped into Wikidata, since many of Wikidata's claims (the atomic elements of its
        knowledge base) have been kindly contributed by Freebase, a Google acquisition in 2016.
        Besides, it is precisely the purpose of these large-scale knowledge repositories to be
        used by... everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        To summarize: building the LOD cloud is a scientific endeavor, it is about observing
        what engineers publish on the Web; building large-scale knowledge graphs (DBpedia,
        Wikidata, YAGO) looks more like engineering/doing. Wherever the border science and
        engineering tends to blur, the French talk about 'sciences de l'ingénieur' or about
        sciences that consist in observing what engineers are doing. There is no direct
        translation but one can think of these "sciences of engineering" as whatever the MIT
        might be interested in. This kind of research has more to do with technologies than
        with observing nature. As engineers feel observed, they start implementing what
        researchers formalize and there occurs a shift in our dialectics: engineers do (or
        reproduce) what scientists observe.
    </p>

    <h2>Science as Knowledge</h2>
    
    <p>
        It is not too hard to recognize how mechanical engineering, computing and control
        systems may relate to science. Scientists simply take engineers' problems as the
        starting point of their theories, which engineers then turn into new technologies.
        However, things get a little bit more complex when it comes to knwoledge.
    </p>

    <p>
        Indeed, the actual purpose of any kind of science is to produce new knowledge. The
        german word for 'science' ('Wissenschaft') is literally a concatenation of
        'knowledge' ('Wissen') and 'whatever-is-derived-from' ('-schaft'). So, what is the
        specific purpose of a 'knowledge science'? Is it some kind of 'science of science'?
        That discipline already has a name. It is called 'epistemology'. In fact, what most
        Semantic Web researcher is doing has more to do with knowledge <em>representation</em>
        than anything else. That means, while other scientists create their own language to
        devise theories about the world (or to help create new technologies, as above), other
        scientists strive to unify them, the same way linguists search for similarities between
        Swahili and Finnish. (Quite naturally, one ends up with a <a href="babelnet.org/">'Babel
        network'</a> to represent knowledge.)
    </p>

    <p>
        For what it is worth, first-order logic seems to establish itself as the reference language
        for all sorts of theories. But there is still a long path until engineers actually do
        anything with that observation.

            Note (left as an exercise): given
            <a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/intelligence">the following Oxford
            dictionary definition</a>, how would you classify the various activities carried on in
            the field of artificial intelligence: 'intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply
            knowledge and skills'?
