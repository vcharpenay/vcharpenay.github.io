# Hands-On Introduction to Semantic Interoperability

_Step-by-step tutorial to Semantic Web technologies with focus on
interoperability in the Internet of Things (IoT)._

The tutorial revolves around the idea that every participant builds their own
semantic model of the conference room they will be sitting in. They will be
invited to model in terms of object classes and relationship between them the
features they consider of interest like room dimensions, the furniture and
digital equipment it contains, the various physical properties that can be
measured in it, etc. At the end of the tutorial, the expected result is a
browsable graph of interlinked classes with alignments across different models
(sub-class relation- ships, attribute references, equivalences, etc.). As a
baseline, different models extracted from oneM2M, OCF and OMA LWM2M schema
definitions will be available.

The tutorial is organized in four phases:
1. First, after setting up the tools required for the tutorial, participants
create a model using the GraphQL schema language, a generic language sharing
many features with C and Java.
2. Participants can use a command-line tool to transform their GraphQL
schema into a semantic model defined as a schema.org extension. Then,
participants can register the output semantic model on a server that generates
an HTML documentation of their model. A good documentation
of each term should be provided for later alignment.
3. After a brief introduction to semantics and the concept of interpretation,
participants can experiment with the result of applying different semantics
to their model: F-logic (the implicit semantics of the GraphQL query
language), RDFS and OWL DL.
4. Participants are asked to browse others' models and try to find possible
alignments with theirs. Alignments are defined via a Web form.
